1. Where to add my `prepublish` hook

2. How should I use `precommit` hooks with `lint-staged` per project. Is it possible to do
this on a per package basis?

3. Will lerna run a pre-publish hook when I bootstrap a project which perhaps has packages which require to be compiled with `babel` to a `lib` directory before use.

4. How would I be using `yarn` workspaces to improve caching of these packages? (Ridiculous question, there might be a blog post floating around).
